## interview-prep
A React Next.TS app that you can use to create questions and study existing TypeScript and React questions. This was also used to help me learn Docker, Entity Framework, and minimal ASP.Net Core APIs

## Other Important Notes
I originally created this application to be able to add questions and answers to help me review TypeScript and React questions. I wanted to create this project with DDD in mind, but Next.js doesn't allow classes with Server Actions. This is a huge loss for taking a Domain Driven Design approach as classes are the core concept behind the implementation of it. Not to say some parts of DDD couldn't be implemented in this project. They certainly can. One example would be with State management on the entity. Where the business logic should live. As I've continued working through this project, I find that I've enjoyed learning about Server Side Rendering, and have focused on the key concepts of Next rather than trying to implement DDD within it. I've also decided not to focus on Redux for state management as I originally wanted to because there isn't a need for it in the current state of the project.
